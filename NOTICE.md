This software is available under three licenses: the GNU GPL version 2 (or at your option, a later version), the Perl Artistic license, or the MIT license. Note that my preference for licensing is the MIT license, but the original Perl MIME::Types was dually originally licensed with the Perl Artistic and the GNU GPL (“the same terms as Perl itself”) and given that the Ruby implementation hewed pretty closely to the Perl version, I must maintain the additional licensing terms.
